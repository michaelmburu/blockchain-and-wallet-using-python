## Description

The Python Blockchain and Wallet Implementation project provides a comprehensive solution for creating and managing a blockchain and wallets. It includes the following main components:

1. **Blockchain**: This module handles the creation and management of the blockchain, including adding new blocks, validating transactions, and maintaining the chain integrity.

2. **Transaction**: This module defines the structure of transactions, including inputs, outputs, and transaction signing using digital signatures.

3. **Wallet**: This module enables the creation and management of wallets, including generating new addresses, sending transactions, and managing account balances.

4. **Network**: This module implements a basic peer-to-peer network for broadcasting transactions and blocks across the blockchain network.
